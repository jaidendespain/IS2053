# Instructions

Using the following values: 4, 18, 12, 9, 2, 17, 24, find and print the mean and median using any programming procedures you have learned in this course.


MEAN: Can be found by adding all the values and dividing them by the number of elements.  


MEDIAN: Since the number of values is odd, you can find the value in the exact middle (since there are 7 values, then the middle value would have 3 below and 3 above.  This means the values must be sorted first).
