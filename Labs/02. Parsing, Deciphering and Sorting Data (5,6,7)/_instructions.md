# Instructions

In this lab, you will write a Python program that opens a text file containing several paragraphs of written material, which also contains about a dozen numbers randomly placed throughout the text. Your program will extract the integer values from the file and store them in a list. You will then sort the list, determine its length, and print the value located directly in the middle of the list. There should be one and only one value that is the exact middle (median) value of the sorted list, provided that your program correctly identifies all instances of integers in the text file.

To complete this lab, you will need to utilize the following programming concepts:
- File input/output.
- Lists and tuples.
- Indexing.
- Functions.
- Passing arguments to receiving parameters.
- Parsing data using keywords like strip.
- Differentiating between string and integer data types in .text-based documents.
