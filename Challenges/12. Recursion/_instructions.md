# Instructions

In this programming challenge, you will create a program using functional programming techniques that includes two functions named factorial(n) and findPrime(n). Additionally, a third function named menu() will allow the user to choose between finding the factorial of a number and determining if a number is prime or not based on the input they enter.


1. Create a function named factorial(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

2. Create a function named findPrime(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether n is prime or not.

3. Create a function named menu() that prompts the user to choose between finding the factorial of a number and checking if a number is prime. Then, prompt the user to enter the number they want to evaluate.

4. If the user selects factorial, call the factorial(n) function with the user's input and print the result.

If the user selects prime, call the findPrime(n) function with the user's input and print either "n is prime" or "n is not prime" depending on the Boolean value returned by the function.


Note that you don't need to show all prime numbers leading up to the entered number, just determine whether it is prime or not.
