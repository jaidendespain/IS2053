# Instructions

For this challenge you will create a program that contains a class called PlayerCharacter.  Your class will use the def __init__ method to create the following attributes:   health, armor rating, attack power.    Health can be from 1 - 100.  Armor Rating and Attack Power are from 1 - 20.  DO NOT let the user enter a value outside of this range.  You will then create an object from the PlayerCharacter class called Wizard.  Next, you will create a main() function that asks the user to input each of the values associated with the PlayerCharacter Attributes.  Finally, you will print the Wizard's attributes to the console.  


1. Create a class called PlayerCharacter with attributes: health, armor rating, and attack power.
2. Use the 'def init' method to initialize the attributes and ensure that the values entered by the user are within the range of 1 - 100 for health and 1 - 20 for armor rating and attack power.
3. Implement set methods for health, armor rating, and attack power to ensure that the values entered by the user are within the valid range.
4. Implement get methods to return the values of health, armor rating, and attack power.
5. Create an object from the PlayerCharacter class called Wizard.
6. Create a main() function that asks the user to input the values associated with the PlayerCharacter attributes.
7. Use the set methods to set the values of health, armor rating, and attack power for the Wizard object.
8. Use the get methods to print the Wizard's attributes to the console.
