# Instructions

For this challenge you will write a small program that asks a user (the person using your program) if they would like to try and guess a number from 1-50.  IF the user guesses the exact number (which will be 30 for everyone), you will print this exact statement (check your spelling):  "Congratulations.  You guessed the correct number.". If the user is within 5 points (above or below the number) tell them "You were within 5 numbers of the correct value."  If they choose anything else, tell the user "That is not the correct number."  Do not deviate from the output statements in any way!


#### Elements of the Program:

1. Ask the user if they wish to play the game.

2. If yes, then ask them to guess a number from 1-50

    - If no, then tell the user goodbye and end the program (do NOT use any sort of looping structure for this program)

3. If the user plays the game and types in a value that is within 5 points of the correct value, print out "You were within 5 numbers of the correct value."

    - If the user plays the game and chooses the exact value, tell them "Congratulations.  You guessed the correct number."

    - if the user chooses anything else, tell them "That is not the correct number."
