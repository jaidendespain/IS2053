# Instructions

1. Ask the user to enter their name.

2. Ask the user to enter their birth year.

3. Using only the user's birth year, determine their current age.

4. Print the user's name, birth year, and current age.

> NOTE: You DO NOT need the month they were born, as that is a bit harder to do here.  We are looking for approximation only.
