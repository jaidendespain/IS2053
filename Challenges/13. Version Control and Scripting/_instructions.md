# Instructions

In this challenge, you will create a program that determines whether a user-inputted value is a valid phone number or not.


1. A valid phone number must be 9 digits long.

2. Each portion of the phone number must be separated by a dash.

- For example, if the user enters "555-234-5567", the program should return "555-234-5567 is a phone number." However, if the user enters "phone number," the program should return "That is not a valid phone number."

- The following are examples of invalid phone numbers:
954-55R-T1056 
95-567-7890
9-5-5-67-789
