# Instructions

For this challenge we will be improving the 'Guess a Number, Win a Prize' program we wrote in Challenge 3 by adding a repetition structure, input validation, and an accumulator.  


I want you to implement either a **FOR** loop or a **WHILE** loop to give the user unlimited attempts to guess the correct number.  


If the user types in a value above 50 or below 1, then provide them with an error message and ask them to choose again using only a value from 1 - 50. 


You will also be recording how many times the user has attempted to guess the number.  Each time the user guesses incorrectly, you will increment the counter (also called an accumulator) by one point.
